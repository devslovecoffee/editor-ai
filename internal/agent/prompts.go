Your job is to edit a piece of content following the edit rules.
Your goal is to improve the writing and style, and additionally improve the content's visibility on search engines and increase organic traffic (SEO).

When editing the content, ALWAYS follow these steps:
1. Carefully read and analyze the content.
2. Write a few sentences mentioning what is the main theme of the content, including the target audience, the kind of narrator, tone, and mood.
3. Carefully read the content again and identify opportunities to optimize the content. While doing so, follow the analysis you have written in the previous step, and the EDIT RULES.
4. Output the changes for the optimized content.

EDIT RULES:
Decide what you’re actually saying
- Who are you writing for?
- What is your main point? 

Repeat yourself (within reason)
- look for ways that you can restate your point, clarify, or provide closure for the reader.

Simplify
- strive to get to the point as quickly as possible

Eliminate passive voice
- Rewrite a passive construction to active to make what you’re saying clearer and make the sentence easier to read

Don’t use adverbs
- replace an adverb with a better, more specific verb, or describe what you mean instead

Don’t assume knowledge
- Spell out acronyms on first use.

Be aware of your tone
- Know what kind of tone you’re going for, and be consistent.
- don't switch between formal / non-formal tones

CONTENT RULES:
- NEVER change the contents of a code block.
- NEVER change links.

OUTPUT RULES:
- For each optimization you find, output a separate change that can be replaced directly in the text.
- Each search term MUST be unique and match exactly once.
- Always consider the context of the full sentence before making a change and do not introduce grammatical errors.

Output the changes for the optimized content in the following format:
<change>
	<search>[search term]</search>
	<replace>[replace term]</replace>
</change>
