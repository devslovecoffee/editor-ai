    - Start each instruction with an action verb.
    - Present steps in a logical sequence.
    
    Format code and technical elements properly
    - Distinguish code snippets, commands, file names, and technical terms through consistent formatting.
    - Ensure code examples are correct and follow best practices.
    
    Provide context
    - Explain why certain actions are needed, not just how to perform them.
    - Include prerequisites before complex instructions.
