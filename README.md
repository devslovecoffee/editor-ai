## Overview

Writing requires a focus on content creation without distractions. **Editor AI** is an open-source **AI-powered content editing tool** that automatically enhances content with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

By utilizing **automated editing and search engine optimization (SEO)**, Editor AI ensures your content remains **high-quality, engaging, and up-to-date**, without extra effort.

- Hands-free workflow ‚Äì It eliminates the need for manual editing.

## How It Works

Editor AI improves your content through AI-based text optimization:
1. Reads content from the specified directory.
2. Uses **LLM-powered optimization** to refine and improve the text.
3. Applies any enhancements directly to your files.
4. Saves the improved content automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed (>=1.18)
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/petttr1/editor-ai.git
cd editor-ai
```

## Usage

Run the program with the required flags:

```sh
go run main.go --dir "absolute/path/to/files" --api_key "your_openai_api_key"
```

If desired, specify a glob pattern to target particular files (e.g., markdown):

```sh
go run main.go --dir "absolute/path/to/files" --api_key "your_openai_api_key" --glob "*.md"
```

### Command-line Arguments

|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `optimizeSystemPrompt`     | `internal/llm/prompts.go`  | Keep the `{{ .OutputRules }}` and `{{ .OutputFormat }}` within the prompt. Without this, the output may not be correct.                                |
| `optimizeUserPrompt` | `internal/llm/prompts.go`  | Keep the `{{ .OutputRules }}` and `{{ .OutputFormat }}` within the prompt. Without this, the output may not be correct.                                |

| `contentRules`    | `internal/llm/rules.go`    | Edit if you have specific content that you don't want to be edited (e.g. Code blocks, figures, configs).                                               |
| `replaceExamples`    | `internal/llm/examples.go` | If you notice the editor making a mistake on some part of your content, provide it as an example with the incorrect and the correct (expected output). |
